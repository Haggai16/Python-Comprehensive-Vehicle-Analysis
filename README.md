# Comprehensive Vehicle Analysis: Exploring Car Attributes and Market Trends
## Overview
This repository contains a detailed analysis of a vehicle dataset, focusing on exploring various car attributes, their market pricing, and performance characteristics. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and visualization to provide insights into automotive industry trends.

## Project Objectives
- Data Cleaning: Address missing values, remove duplicates, and convert data types to ensure data quality and usability.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of different attributes like car makes, pricing, engine size, and more.
- Predictive Modeling: Build a regression model to predict the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) based on key features such as engine size, horsepower, and vehicle weight.
- Visualization: Create visual representations of data to uncover patterns and trends across different vehicle characteristics.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis comprises various attributes of cars, including:

- Make
- Model
- Type
- Origin
- DriveTrain
- MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price)
- Invoice Price
- Engine Size
- Cylinders
- Horsepower
- MPG (Miles Per Gallon) for City and Highway
- Weight
- Wheelbase
- Length

## Tools Used
- Python: For performing data manipulation and statistical analysis.
- Pandas: For data handling and manipulation.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Scikit-Learn: For building and evaluating the regression model.

## Key Findings
- Pricing Analysis: Insights into how different factors like make and origin affect the vehicle's price.
- Fuel Efficiency Analysis: How vehicle type and drivetrain influence fuel economy.
- Weight Distribution: Exploration of how the weight of vehicles varies across different types and origins.
- Predictive Analysis: A regression model predicting vehicle prices with an R-squared value of 0.77, indicating a strong model fit.
  
## Visualizations
Visualizations in this project help in understanding complex patterns and relationships between multiple variables. They include:

- Histograms of vehicle weights.
- Scatter plots showing relationships between horsepower, engine size, and MSRP.
- Bar charts comparing the average prices and other metrics across different makes and types.
